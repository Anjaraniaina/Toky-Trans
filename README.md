# Toky-Trans
## About this project 
It's a local project that we call "Toky-trans" which consists in modeling a database of a cooperative with requests that we find interesting.

## Getting started
Note that you need [psql](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-psql.html) to use this project.
First, to create the database along with the tables, open psql and type:

```
\i CreateTable.sql
```

You are now connected to the database. Now in the folder [insert](./insert/), you should see some inserts to work on.
To insert into the tables, type:

```
\i yourInsert.sql
```

Note that you can make your own insert by following PostgreSQL syntax.
Now that you're done with the inserts, [here](./Requests-Response/) are some interseting requests for this database.
To make a request, type:

```
\i theRequest.sql
```

The list of these requests are [here](./Requests-Subjects/).
